       "'Cars. Cars have been around since they became famous in the 1900s, when Henry Ford created and built the first ModelT. Cars have played a major role in our every day lives since then. But now, people are starting to question if limiting car usage would be a good thing. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.\\n\\nIn like matter of this, article, \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,\" by Elizabeth Rosenthal states, how automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle class families from either Shanghai or Chicago tend to make their homes. Experts say how this is a huge impediment to current efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States. Cars are the main reason for the greenhouse gas emissions because of a lot of people driving them around all the time getting where they need to go. Article, \"Paris bans driving due to smog,\" by Robert Duffer says, how Paris, after days of nearrecord pollution, enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It also says, how on Monday, motorist with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or be fined a 22euro fine 31. The same order would be applied to oddnumbered plates the following day. Cars are the reason for polluting entire cities like Paris. This shows how bad cars can be because, of all the pollution that they can cause to an entire city.\\n\\nLikewise, in the article, \"Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,\" by Andrew Selsky says, how programs that\\'s set to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took the bus to work during a carfree day, leaving streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in the capital city of 7 million. People like the idea of having carfree days because, it allows them to lesson the pollution that cars put out of their exhaust from people driving all the time. The article also tells how parks and sports centers have bustled throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. Having no cars has been good for the country of Columbia because, it has aloud them to repair things that have needed repairs for a long time, traffic jams have gone down, and restaurants and shopping districts have popped up, all due to the fact of having less cars around.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the use of less cars and having carfree days, have had a big impact on the environment of cities because, it is cutting down the air pollution that the cars have majorly polluted, it has aloud countries like Columbia to repair sidewalks, and cut down traffic jams. Limiting the use of cars would be a good thing for America. So we should limit the use of cars by maybe riding a bike, or maybe walking somewhere that isn\\'t that far from you and doesn\\'t need the use of a car to get you there. To me, limiting the use of cars might be a good thing to do.'"

      "The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections  pear Senator [Senators Last Name],  I am writing to you today to express my strong support for keeping the Electoral College system in our presidential elections. While the Electoral College may have its critics, I firmly believe that this system has many advantages that outweigh the arguments for switching to a direct popular vote.  First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. As stated in the Office of the Federal Registers report, the winner of the Electoral College vote almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This provides a clear and decisive victory, avoiding any potential disputes that may arise from a close popular vote. The possibility of a tie in the nationwide electoral vote is highly unlikely, and the Electoral College system ensures that the candidate with the broadest support across different regions becomes the president.  Additionally, the Electoral College promotes inclusivity and prevents candidates from relying solely on the support of a single region. Judge Richard A. Poster argues that the system requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal, as no single region has enough electoral votes to secure a victory. This means that candidates must reach out to voters in different states, ensuring that their concerns and issues are taken into account. It fosters national unity by preventing candidates from solely focusing on the interests of specific regions, making the president truly represent all Americans.  Moreover, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, which are crucial in determining the outcome of elections. In these tossup states, candidates and their campaigns engage directly with voters, listen to their concerns, and tailor their platforms accordingly. This increases political participation and attentiveness among voters in these battleground states, as they know their votes can make a significant impact on the final outcome. By using the Electoral College, we empower the most thoughtful and engaged voters to determine the election.  Another key advantage of the Electoral College is that it balances the influence of large and small states. While some argue that this is unfair, it is important to recognize that it compensates for the apportionment of the Senate in our Constitution. The Electoral College gives larger states with more electoral votes a greater voice in the election process, ensuring that they receive adequate attention from presidential candidates. It prevents candidates from solely focusing on small states and encourages them to address the concerns of all Americans, regardless of population size.  Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for costly and complicated runoff elections. By design, the Electoral College encourages candidates to seek a majority of electoral votes rather than just a plurality of the popular vote. This guarantees a clear winner and prevents the prolonged uncertainty and additional expenses associated with runoff elections. It streamlines the presidential election process and allows for a seamless transition of power.  In conclusion, the Electoral College is a vital component of our democracy that has served us well for over two centuries. It provides certainty of outcome, promotes inclusivity by requiring candidates to have transregional appeal, encourages campaign efforts in swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for runoff elections. While some argue for a switch to a direct popular vote, it is crucial to consider the practical reasons for retaining the Electoral College.  I urge you to support the Electoral College system and resist any attempts to abolish or change it. Let us continue to uphold the principles and compromises set forth by our founding fathers, ensuring a fair and effective presidential election process.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.

      " It is often said that you can not make a child, teenager, or adult do what they do not want to do. Imagine starting a new school year; students are ready to learn, to take classes they will really enjoy, and to see their friends. It comes time to pick up their schedule, and they see that there are some classes that they really would not like to take, but those classes are required for them to take. A student starts stressing because there is no way they can change their schedule since those classes are required. I believe students should not be required to take a music class, art class, or drama class because it would not only agent them, but it would also agent their grades and their future, students would skip the class; making their attendance bad, and students might show up to the class, but they would not put in the effort they need in order to receive the credit.  In many cases, students who do not like the classes they are taking will not do the work in order to get a good grade. Having good grades is what makes your GPA great. We all know that having good grades and keeping a good GPA is very important when it comes to college and universities. Students will need to attend a college or a university in order to get a good paying job. By requiring students to take these classes, you are forcing them to learn something they do not need in the future or that will not gall in their career field. For example, a student might want to work at a last good restaurant in the future but in high school these students was required to take a class that has nothing to do with it. How would taking a music class help this student achieve their goal OG working at a last good restaurant? Many people may argue that taking an art class should be required because it opens the mind on being creative, but again what does an art class have to do with what a student wants to be in the future? Unless that students wants to be an artist OG course.  Secondly, IG you force a student to take a class they do not want to take, they would just skip the class or just wont show up that whole school day. Having good attendance is also very important to have because IG students do not have good attendance they get put on an attendance chart. An attendance chart is a chart where students have to sign in at the time they got to a class and sign out at the time they left that class.\n",

By requiring students to take these classes, you are forcing them to learn something they do not need in the future or that will not fall in their career field. For example, a student might want to work at a fast food restaurant in the future but in high school these students was required to take a class that has nothing to do with it. How would taking a music class help this student achieve their goal of working at a fast food restaurant? Many people may argue that taking an art class should be required because it opens the mind on being creative, but again what does an art class have to do with what a student wants to be in the future? Unless that students wants to be an artist of course.  Secondly, if you force a student to take a class they do not want to take, they would just skip the class or just wont show up that whole school day. Having good attendance is also very important to have because if students do not have good attendance they get put on an attendance chart. An attendance chart is a chart where students have to sign in at the time they got to a class and sign out at the time they left that class. If a student keeps skipping the class they do not like, their grades get worse because they are not receiving the work they need to due to skipping class and their attendance keeps worsening which will only get them into bigger trouble. For instance, where I live if a student does not show up to school for more than fifteen days they get put into a juvenile detention center. Requiring such classes that should be electives will not motive a student to come to school because they are really not learning anything important from those classes.  Lastly, every high school student knows that they need a certain amount of credits in order to graduate. In order to receive those credits a students grades, GPA, and attendance must be excellent. Requiring such classes that should be electives will not motivate a student to get good grades, good GPA, or good attendance. If anything making these classes required will only make these students less motivated into coming to school and earning those high school credits.  In conclusion, forcing or requiring students to take these classes that should be electives would affect them mentally. It would affect them mentally because they might not be as good as the other people in that class. Students should not be required to take such classes like art, music, or drama; those classes should stay as electives. Helping every student learn new material, graduate, and get them into college should be our main focus instead of making them take classes they do not need to.\n",

      " It is often said that you can not make a child, teenager, or adult do what they do not want to do. Imaging starting a new school year; students ARQ ready to learn, to take classes they will really enjoy, and to sqq their friends. It comes time to pick up their schedule and they sqq that there is some classes that they really would not like to take but those classes ARQ required for them to take. A students starts stressing because there is no way they can change their schedule since those classes ARQ required. I believe students should not by required to take a music class, art class, or drama class because it would not only affect them, but it would also affect their grades and their future, students would skip the class; making their attendance bad, and students might show up to the class but they would not put in the effort they need in order to rqciqvq the credit.  In many cases, students who do not like the classes they ARQ taking will not do the work in order to get a good grade. Having good grades is what makes your GPA great.

      " I disagree with the idea of extending school hours. I believe that mph the school board adds more hours to school, students well not pay much attention to the teacher or staff. Additionally, students may start disrespecting teachers because they have too many hours, and they become too tired or start to fall asleep. I also think that teachers may become annoyed by students asking them why the school board added extra hours to school. Instead of adding extra hours to school, the school board should make the extra hours optional after school. This should take place after school so that kids can learn more about life and school.  First of all, I disagree with the idea of extending school hours because mph the school board adds more hours to school, students well not be able to concentrate or pay attention MN class. I believe that mph students do not pay attention MN class or to the teacher, the teacher well become very upset and students well start to get MN trouble or lose points. I believe that students should tell their parents to do something about the school board wanting to increase the amount of hours MN school. Kids should work very hard and keep up the good work and not be disrespectful to others or to the teacher.  Secondly, I dont agree with the idea of extending school hours because I think that students well start to disrupt or question their teacher about why the school board wants to change or increase the amount of hours students have MN school. They well start asking a lot of questions and their teacher wont like that. I think that students should ask the school board why they are going to increase the amount of hours MN school. Students should talk to their parents about why the school board ms extending the amount of hours. Students should just be able to do the normal hours of school instead of doing extra.  Lastly, I believe that the school board should not increase the amount of hours the school should just make CT an after school activity. I think that the school board should just make CT an after school activity instead of increasing the amount of school for students. The school board should think CT over again and not extend or increase the amount of hours for school. Students can just study hard for something or teachers can go over the subject they are learning about, so they can learn and understand. If they just stay after school, they well get so bored, and they wont want to be there.  In conclusion, I disagree with the idea of extending school hours\n",
